# Final game idea: Vertical-Scrolling Shooter Game

Name: TBC


Paper prototype video:

https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-10/assets/148199198/728b9f47-211e-4607-9fb6-e255dce2f6ae

## 1.Description:

A 2D game where the user will pilot a spaceship on the screen controlled using 
the keyboard. Enemies will appear dynamically along with others set up statically 
on the map. The goal is to earn points by defeating enemies and to evade attacks
from the enemies to survive. As points increase, the difficulty level increases
and the map landscape and enemies may change and become more difficult.

## 2.Controls:

W = Up
A = Left
S = Down
D = Right
Space = Shoot

## 3.Features discussed:

- Fire system upgrading
- Bonus points earned by coins from destroyed enemies
- Ability to select between different spaceship designs

## 4.Potential challenges:

- Accurate collision detection range for objects; distinguishing different
  interactions for different game object types (eg. bullets, coins, enemies)
- 2-player mode implementation
- Resurrection / Extra lives system; carrying on with previous fire system

**Use case reflection**
Creating several use case specifications allowed the group to break down the game into its different components, enabling us to explore key detaisl of the game. The key use case specifications for our game include: level design, optimisation, unique features and user interface. Each specification focused on specific elements of the game and helped us refine each part. For example, in the level design we decided on 2 main levels that the player can choose from - endless mode and speed mode. Furthermore, it allowed us to think about how each element of the game will integrate with each other. For example, a unique feature is enemy-spawning aliens, which needed to be adapted to fit each game mode. This process gave us a high level understanding of the game, which will aid us when planning the game.
(Finish by adding a reflection about the use case diagram)
