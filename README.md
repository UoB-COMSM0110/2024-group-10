# Final game idea: Vertical-Scrolling Shooter Game

Name: TBC


Paper prototype video:

https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-10/assets/148199198/728b9f47-211e-4607-9fb6-e255dce2f6ae

## 1.Description:

A 2D game where the user will pilot a spaceship on the screen controlled using 
the keyboard. Enemies will appear dynamically along with others set up statically 
on the map. The goal is to earn points by defeating enemies and to evade attacks
from the enemies to survive. As points increase, the difficulty level increases
and the map landscape and enemies may change and become more difficult.

## 2.Controls:

W = Up
A = Left
S = Down
D = Right
Space = Shoot

## 3.Features discussed:

- Fire system upgrading
- Bonus points earned by coins from destroyed enemies
- Ability to select between different spaceship designs

## 4.Potential challenges:

- Accurate collision detection range for objects; distinguishing different
  interactions for different game object types (eg. bullets, coins, enemies)
- 2-player mode implementation
- Resurrection / Extra lives system; carrying on with previous fire system
