Use Case: Aircraft Control and Collision Detection Optimization
1.	Use Case Name: Aircraft Control and Collision Detection Optimization
2.	Brief Description: Two key optimizations—refined aircraft turning control and continuous high-precision collision detection—to significantly enhance the player's control experience and the accuracy of interactions.
o	Refined Turning Control: Turning is no longer just a simple change in angle but can smoothly transition from slow to fast turning based on the duration of the player's inputs, making the control feel more natural and nuanced.
o	Continuous High-Precision Collision Detection: Collision detection in the game goes beyond simple rectangular or circular bounding boxes, enabling precise matching based on the actual contours of the aircraft and bullets.
3.	Precondition: The player has started the game and is in control of the aircraft.
Basic Flow:
1.	Players control the aircraft's direction using the keyboard to dodge attacks.
2.	When the player simultaneously presses the "W+A" keys on the keyboard, it results in turning left, and pressing "W+D" results in turning right. The game engine dynamically adjusts the turning speed and angle of the aircraft based on the duration of the simultaneous pressing of the "W" key (forward) and either the "A" or "D" key (left or right).
3.	The game system generates bullet patterns based on the current level design and updates the aircraft's position in response to the player's actions.
4.	Accurate collision detection is performed in real-time, based on the actual contours of the aircraft and bullets, to determine if the aircraft has come into contact with bullets or enemies.
5.	If a collision is detected, the game executes corresponding outcomes based on the nature of the collision, such as reducing life points or displaying explosion effects, and provides immediate feedback to the player.
6.	The game interface is updated to display the player's current life points and score.
7.	The player continues to challenge the level by dodging bullets and enemy attacks until the objective is achieved or the game ends.
Alternative Flows:
1.	Player Customizes Direction Key Settings
i.	The player goes to settings, modifies control options, and changes direction keys (e.g., from “W+A”, “W+D” to other combinations).
ii.	The game confirms the changes and updates controls to match the new key settings.
iii.	The player navigates the aircraft with the new keys. The game adjusts its interface and feedback accordingly, ensuring smooth and intuitive control.
2.	Player Customizes Collision Detection Precision:
i.	The player opens the game's settings menu and selects collision detection precision options.
ii.	The player chooses a desired precision level for collision detection, ranging from low to high.
iii.	Upon confirmation, the game updates its collision detection system to match the chosen precision level.
